      "Women’s participation in the labor force remains concentrated in sectors defined as the service sphere with 71.4% of women employed in this sector compared to 52% of the men. Women and men are fairly evenly represented in agriculture, forestry, and fishery, where 17.1% of women are employed compared to 18.9% for men. The percentage of women employed in agriculture declined by 34% from 2006 to 2016). However, as women move out of agriculture, they are remaining in lower-paying service sector positions rather than accessing higher-paying industrial jobs. This happens because of traditional education (women graduated from schools for beauticians, hairdressers, and caregivers) but also because of gender roles in which it is very important for a woman to strike a balance between private and business life, and because of this, it is harder for her to progress in her career.",
